Hello! Welcome to the Introduction to Neuro/AI i2 (Interactive Intelligence) crash course! If you are reading this, you are most likely a member of our team (if not, be sure to ask around and join the discord!)

We hope you are excited to learn more about machine learning and its intersection with neuroscience. To get started, check out the `schedule.md` file and jump into the current week!

Please remember:

- This course is somewhat of a commitment. You will get out what you put in
- There are no grades! This is all for your learning alone.
- Contact any mentor at any point if you have any questions. **Seriously, we are here to help <3**
