# I2 Intro Course Schedule

Here's a tentative schedule for the I2 intro group.

Note: I'm still unsure about what material/topics should be covered (and don't want to solely develop the syllabus) - this is a rough draft, open to change.

- Get acquainted with I2
- Learn some of the pre-reqs necessary (Python)

### Resources

- [CS50x Intro to Python Course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/). Doing the first lectures and psets would likely be enough to start off with.

## Week 1: 1/9 - 1/15

### Purpose

- Learn some of the pre-reqs necessary (calculus, linear algebra)

### Resources

- TODO: ADD CALCULUS AND LINEAR ALGEBRA RESOURCES, derivatives, partial derivatives, vectors, hyperplanes

### Assignment

- N/A, get familiar with the pre-reqs!

### Summary Questions

- N/A

  - Unit 1
  - Unit 2
- [CS231n Notes on Neural Networks.](https://cs231n.github.io/) See Module 1: Neural Networks - great written resource for the basics.

## Week 4: 1/30 - 2/5

### Purpose

- Review NN's
- Work through backpropagation

### Resources

- [Karpathy micrograd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0) (simple version of backprop and how PyTorch autograd works). Watch this video (you're going to implement it!)
- [CS231n Notes - Backpropagation, Intuitions](https://cs231n.github.io/optimization-2/). Optional if you want review or a new explanation of backpropagation. 

### Assignment

- Watch and implement micrograd. Use the starter code linked **here**.
- Implement the ReLU nonlinearity for the Value class. (Note: if you're having a hard time with this, take a look at [this](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd/blob/master/micrograd/engine.py) code.)
- Implement and train a small neural network using micrograd. The training, validation, and test data will be included in the starter code. - Try to find the best network you can! You might want to change the learning rate, size of the network, or Note your training, validation, and test loss for your best network.

### Summary Questions

- In what direction do gradients flow (with regards to loss)?
- How do gradients flow through addition? How do they flow through the ReLU function?
- What was your best loss for the test dataset?
- Was there something that stood out to you? Something that confused you?
- What's one resource that was helpful (suggested or found on your own)?

### Summary Questions

- What do CNN's do in terms of features?
- (If we did an assignment on imagenet), what was your maximum accuracy?
- What is "stride" for a convolutional layer?
