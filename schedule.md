# I2 Intro Course Schedule

Here's a tentative schedule for the I2 intro group.

Note: I'm still unsure about what material/topics should be covered (and don't want to solely develop the syllabus) - this is a rough draft, open to change.

---

## Week 0: 1/3 - 1/8

### Purpose

- Get acquainted with I2
- Learn some of the pre-reqs necessary (Python, calculus, linear algebra)

### Resources

- [CS50x Intro to Python Course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/). Doing the first lectures and psets would likely be enough to start off with.
- [I2 Resources Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tzLTPxLt93d0RV70gik2K0pr5LbW614q1FXUbKIoUP8/edit?usp=sharing)
- [CS231n notes on Python, Numpy, and Jupyter Notebooks](https://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/)

### Assignment

- N/A, get familiar with the pre-reqs!

### Summary Questions

- N/A

### Summary Questions

- N/A

## Week 2: 1/16 - 1/22

### Purpose

- Introduction to ML
- Introduction to Neural Networks

### Resources

- [I2 Resources Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tzLTPxLt93d0RV70gik2K0pr5LbW614q1FXUbKIoUP8/edit?usp=sharing)
- [CS231n Notes on Neural Networks.](https://cs231n.github.io/) See Module 1: Neural Networks - great written resource for the basics.
- **Look at other resources linked in the megadoc**

### Assignment

- Varun has good ideas about this. I'll ask him.
- Possibly rip CS231n's first assignments. They were quite good.

### Summary Questions

- See above
- What's one resource that was helpful (suggested or found on your own)?

## Week 3: 1/23 - 1/29

### Purpose

- Introduction to Neuroscience
- Learn about a Neural Net's real-life counterpart!

### Resources
- [I2 Resources Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tzLTPxLt93d0RV70gik2K0pr5LbW614q1FXUbKIoUP8/edit?usp=sharing)
- I don't really know

### Assignment

- Work through the Basic Neuroanatomy chapter of the I2 Resources Doc, and answer the synthesis questions as you go. 


### Summary Questions

- Synthesis questions in the I2 Resources Doc

---

## Week 4: 1/30 - 2/5

### Purpose

- Review NN's
- Work through backprop (optional!)

### Resources

- [Karpathy micrograd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0) (simple version of backprop and how PyTorch works)
- [CS231n Notes - Neural Networks part:1-3](https://cs231n.github.io/)

### Assignment

- **Maybe [CS231n two layer neural network and/or features](https://cs231n.github.io/assignments2022/assignment1/#q4-two-layer-neural-network). These are good for manually working through deep learning features.**
- **Maybe have people write a version of micrograd and then try to train it? This is more difficult, so I'm hesitant it would be good for everyone.**
- I also like the idea of this being a bit of a "free week", where people have the option of working through micrograd (more math heavy) or try to apply what they've learned to a new problem. We could provide some example problems in this case.

### Summary Questions

- Ask something about what should be supervised while training a NN?
- What are the dangers of using the ReLU function?
- What can happen with a learning rate that is too large/small?
- What's one resource that was helpful (suggested or found on your own)?

## Week 5: 2/6 - 2/12

### Purpose

- Deep Learning for Vision
- Learn about Convolutional Neural Networks

### Resources

- [CS231n Notes on CNNs](https://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/)

### Assignment

- Train on a portion of imagenet? **not sure**

### Summary Questions

- What do CNN's do in terms of features?
- (If we did an assignment on imagenet), what was your maximum accuracy?
- What is "stride" for a convolutional layer?
- What is a pooling layer?
- What is "padding"?
- What's one resource that was helpful (suggested or found on your own)?
