    "##### How to work through this project:\n",
    "- Go cell by cell and finish the marked #TODO's\n",
    "- You don't need to touch the code marked between the `#---------#`. Those are puzzle pieces that your code will fit into!\n",
    "    - However, I **STRONGLY** encourage you to understand every single line between those blocks. They are essential!\n",
    "    - It is crucial that your variable names are what we expect them to be, or the puzzle pieces won't fit.\n",
    "- Tutorials/helpful information will be placed in the `.md` cells above the \"work\" cells. Consult them if you are stuck.\n",
    "- If you REALLY cannot find the correct code to make the cell run, consult the `[proj]-ans.ipynb`.\n",
    "- The final product (what we expect to see if you run all the cells consecutively) will be placed in the `answers/` directory.\n",
    "    - Chances are your output won't be the exact same (stochasticity!) but it should be similar"
